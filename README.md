# STATS744_test

My name is Lim, Kyuson who is enrolled for the STATS 744 for data visualization.
 
I am pleased to share my Toronto COVID-19 patients data visualization for the double donut chart creation. (reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26748069/ggplot2-pie-and-donut-chart-on-same-plot)
 
I think this is creative and useful for showing each sub-proportion of the proportion so to see in beautiful colored mapped chart.  
 
 
Meanwhile, I have completed in R markdown with its out to be sent with.
 
Also, the github repository for the codes is updated for me to show with in the donut chart file.
